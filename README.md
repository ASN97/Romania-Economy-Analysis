# Romania's Economy: Tableau Dashboard Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to an in-depth analysis of Romania's economy through this Tableau dashboard. This project provides a comprehensive overview of key economic indicators and their interrelationships, helping users understand the nation's economic trajectory over the past three decades.

### Key Features:
- **GDP and Inflation Analysis**: View Romania’s GDP growth since the mid-1990s, with notable dips during the 2008 financial crisis, and track inflation, which has stabilized since the 1990s.
- **Unemployment and Foreign Direct Investment Trends**: Analyze fluctuations in Romania's unemployment rate and the volatility in foreign direct investment, especially around economic downturns.
- **Sectoral Breakdown**: A detailed breakdown of value added by economic sectors (services, industry, and agriculture) shows Romania's transition towards a service-oriented economy.
- **Correlation Matrix**: This matrix uncovers relationships between key economic indicators. For example, GDP shows a positive correlation with exports and foreign direct investment, while having negative correlations with inflation and unemployment.

## Insights from the Analysis
1. **GDP Growth and Inflation Control**: Romania has seen steady GDP growth since the 1990s, with inflation dropping significantly from its early highs.
2. **Foreign Direct Investment**: Despite periods of high foreign investment, recent years have shown volatility, particularly after the 2008 financial crisis.
3. **Sectoral Shift**: The Romanian economy is moving towards a service-driven model, with services contributing the largest share to the economy.
4. **Key Relationships**:
   - Strong positive correlation between GDP and exports.
   - Negative correlations between GDP and inflation, as well as unemployment.

## Key Insights for Policy and Investment:
- **Low Inflation & GDP Growth**: Policymakers should focus on maintaining low inflation while encouraging sustained GDP growth.
- **Attracting Foreign Investment**: Strategies are needed to increase and retain foreign investment, especially in light of post-crisis declines.
- **Tackling Unemployment**: Targeted economic policies should aim to manage unemployment effectively during economic downturns.
- **Sectoral Support**: While supporting the growing services sector, attention should also be given to industry and agriculture.
